# Run cargo-mutants locally over the lines changed in HEAD (or any base
# ref you choose), so the runtime is in the "useful while iterating"
# range rather than "leave on overnight."
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/mutants.sh                      # diff HEAD~1..HEAD
#   ./scripts/mutants.sh main                 # diff main..HEAD
#   ./scripts/mutants.sh 0bb7329              # diff <sha>..HEAD
#   ./scripts/mutants.sh HEAD~5               # diff last 5 commits
#   ./scripts/mutants.sh -- --jobs 4          # default base + extra cargo-mutants args
#   ./scripts/mutants.sh main --jobs 4        # explicit base + extra args
#
# The first non-dash argument is the base ref; anything else (and
# everything after the first dash-prefixed arg) passes through to
# cargo-mutants. See https://mutants.rs/ for the full CLI surface.
#
# Why `--in-diff`: an unscoped `cargo mutants` run grows linearly with
# codebase size and routinely runs many hours. `--in-diff` narrows
# mutation to just the lines in the supplied diff — typically seconds
# to minutes for a normal commit.
#
# Prerequisites: `cargo install cargo-mutants` (once per machine).

# --- Project-specific pre-setup ----------------------------------------
# cargo-mutants copies the source tree to a tempdir before building.
# Anything the build expects but that isn't checked in (wasm-pack
# artifacts referenced via include_str!/include_bytes!, generated FFI
# bindings, etc.) won't follow. Mutation testing doesn't exercise those
# bytes at runtime, so empty placeholders are enough.
#
# Example (delete or adapt for your project):
#   mkdir -p crates/foo-viz/pkg
#   touch crates/foo-viz/pkg/foo_viz.js crates/foo-viz/pkg/foo_viz_bg.wasm
